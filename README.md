# Machine_Learning
1. Features - are the one which describe wht it is abt
2. input- Features, model- ML , Output - Lables
3. For dataset - we have UCI
4. Supervised Learning - Classification , Regression
5. Unsupervised Learning - Clustering and association
6. Training and testing dataset

Simple Linear Regresion -

-> Best fit line - Average
-> SSE when we get the best fit line then we try to check for the error
-> after that we do the sum of the squares of the error  
-> if we have independent variable then its easy to predicit the values

Multiple Linear regression -

-> y=mx+b - m - slop and b is the intercept
-> f(x1) = w1x1 + w0 - in the case of - Price, Area
-> f(x1,x2) = w0 + w1x1+ w2x2 - in case more variable 

in this case the whole objective is to find the weights whihc fit best in btw the lable and the Features
if we are getting the value then its regression
and if its trying to distinguish the things then its a classifer
